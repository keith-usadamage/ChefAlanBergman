          Chef Alan Bergman has spent years in the kitchen, creating dishes that work not just once, but over and over again—for families, for guests, and for paying clients.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:10px; color:var(--muted);">
          The Alan Bergman Cooking Academy was created to help you cook better at home without needing a culinary degree. We focus on recipes, prep, flavor, and simple techniques that make a big difference.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px; margin-bottom:10px; color:var(--muted);">
          Our free content—emails, videos, and recipe downloads—is all about making you more confident in the kitchen. When you’re ready to explore catering as a business, we have a separate, paid academy dedicated to that journey.
